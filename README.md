# NMFF
Blind Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for IRF Determination and Data Stream Deconvolution

This package was written initally as an academic project to deconvolve triboluminescent burst events, and determine the instrument response function (IRF) in the process; this was accomplished primarily through iterative convergence, and sub-setting the data and IRF vector and matrix, respectively.

The code is currently usable; however, much refactoring will be performed in future updates to allow for command-line use across platforms, so long as the user has access to Matlab (version will be added soon). There may or may not be future plans to migrate the code-base into a faster, more extensible language; but this will likely be put off unless significant enough interest is displayed.

The article regarding this code was published in The ACS Journal of Analytical Chemistry here: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00120, and all use of the code is allowed, so long as proper reference/attribution is made in the projects using it (pending approval by the principal investigator, this note will be removed when the code is no longer under embargo).
